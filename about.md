# About

Lined Paper is a Jekyll blog theme made to look like college-ruled notebook paper. Created using the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) step by step tutorial. Made by [iangge](https://iangge.github.io) for the purpose of learning front-end development concepts (HTML, CSS, Jekyll, and Figma).
